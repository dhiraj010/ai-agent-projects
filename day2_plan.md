# Day 2 Plan: Reinforcement Learning Basics
A plan for Day 2, including a summary of reinforcement learning (RL) basics and questions to guide my learning.

## Reinforcement Learning Basics (From Video)
Notes from watching a 10-minute video on RL:

- RL is about an agent learning by trying actions and getting rewards, like a dog learning tricks.
- Example: An AI playing a game gets points for winning and learns better moves over time.
- Key parts: Agent (the learner), environment (the world), actions (what it does), rewards (points for good moves).

## RL Basics (From Reading)
A quick summary of reinforcement learning to prepare for Day 2:

- **What Is RL?** An AI method where an agent learns by trying actions and getting rewards, like training a pet with treats.
- **Key Parts**:
  - **Agent**: The learner (e.g., a robot).
  - **Environment**: The world (e.g., a maze).
  - **Actions**: Choices (e.g., move left).
  - **Rewards**: Points for good choices (e.g., +10 for reaching the goal).
  - **Policy**: The strategy it learns (e.g., best path to the goal).
- **Example**: An AI playing a game learns winning moves by earning points.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Games (e.g., chess AI).
  - Robotics (e.g., a robot walking).
  - Smart systems (e.g., a thermostat saving energy).
- **Why It’s Cool**: Unlike my rule-based thermostat, RL agents learn from experience, making them smarter for complex tasks.

## Questions for Day 2
Questions to guide my reinforcement learning exploration:

- How can I use RL to make my thermostat agent learn energy-saving settings?
- What’s the difference between RL and my PyTorch linear regression example?
- How do I code a simple RL example in Python, like a game?
- Can I combine RL with LangChain or AutoGen for smarter agents?
- What’s Q-learning, and can I try it easily?
- Do I need special libraries like PyTorch for RL?
- How long does it take an RL agent to learn something useful?

**Why These Questions?** They help me connect RL to my projects (e.g., thermostat agent) and understand how to start coding it.
